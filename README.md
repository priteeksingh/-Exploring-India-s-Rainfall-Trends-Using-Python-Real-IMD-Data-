🌧️ Indian Rainfall Analysis using IMD Data
A comprehensive data science project analyzing historical rainfall trends in India using real-world data from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). This project explores rainfall patterns, forecasts future rainfall, and uncovers insights across different Indian subdivisions using Python.

📌 Features
✅ Cleaned and preprocessed real-world IMD data (handling nulls & zero values)

📊 Visualized:

Annual rainfall trends

Monthly rainfall patterns

Decadal monsoon (JJAS) rainfall changes

📉 Identified top 5 wettest and driest years per subdivision

📈 Performed Linear Regression on Year vs JJAS rainfall

🔮 Forecasted next 10 years of rainfall using ARIMA

📌 Highlighted subdivisions with decreasing rainfall using slope analysis

🧠 Correlation heatmap of all months and seasons

📍 Region-specific analysis (e.g., Jammu & Kashmir, Andaman & Nicobar Islands)
